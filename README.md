A DK64 Randomizer Tracker built on Python. Built as there are no available trackers that are Unix-Capable.

## FAQs

How do I get the counters to go back down?
To count down the numbered/list buttons, you can Shift-Click the buttons.

What's next?
To replace the button text with icons! With that, the UI will be made much smaller. After, I'll be working to adjust the colors/formatting to be cleaner overall
